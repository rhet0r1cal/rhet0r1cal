# Nice to meet you, I'm Rhet0r1cal_! 😁

> Website 🌐 ~ https://rhet0rical.dev

I'm a Hobbyist Frontend Web Designer and Game Developer. I mainly use GitHub to put my things somewhere *safe*, since I tend to travel a lot and I use multiple workstations. I love Ryu Ga Gotoku, Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, Risk Of Rain *(or really any roguelike)* and Deep Rock Galactic.

I've been using computers for a majority of my life, and have been in the computer programming clique for about 4-5 years. I'm proficient in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,** and various libraries and tools such as **Node.JS and Firebase**.

If you need to contact me about ANYTHING, i'm mainly reachable at **me@rhet0rical.dev**.
