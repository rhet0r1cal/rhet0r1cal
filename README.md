# Hello :wave: , Im Rhet0rical.
*or Keegan, however you wanna refer to me by.*

## I Make Software :sunglasses: :computer:
I make a **variety** of software (*a majority private since 
it's usually just modifications of other projects, or they just don't work out*). Currently, some
big projects such as **Mocha** - A Python Based Mock Operating System,
and some cool games i've created over at [Studio Eitmos](https://studio-eitmos.com).

Usually, i spend my free time doing things like watching youtube, reading, or **spending way
too much time at my computer doing things not really productive**. Either way, i like to think of
what i do somewhat professional :disguised_face:.

**Now to the professional part**...

I create mostly software using coding languages such as...
* **Python** :snake:
* **Javascript** :coffee:
* **HTML & CSS** :file_folder:

You can mainly check a majority of what i've built in GitHub itself, but sometimes the
projects can be a bit more widespread on different sites such as [Replit](https://repl.it) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_).

If you wish, you can reach me by @tting me on **twitter**, adding me on discord at *Rhet0rical#2001* if you wanna add me there. You can also email me at rhet0rical@studio-eitmos.com.

### **Thanks For Checking Me Out!**
