# Nice to meet you, I'm Rhet0rical ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer based in the United States, tinkering with various web technologies almost all the time. I'm fluent in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Along with Python, and Node.js for more backend server services.

You can find more about me on my [Website](https://rhet0rical.dev).

# Contact & Contribution ðŸ“«
I check my emails almost every day, so feel free to get a hold of me at me@rhet0rical.dev, and if that isn't your style, you can contact me on my Twitter too, using the handle [@TheRhet0rical](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_), and I'll get back to you there instead.

A majority *if not all of my work* has a MIT license attached to them. Athough I may not be avidly working on things at one point, feel free to add any features or additions to any of my projects.
