# Hello, I'm Rhet0rical! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub page! This is usually where I post all of my projects and host my website, so feel free to take a peek at anything I have going on. If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to reach out.

I'm a Software Developer working in the United States. I'm fluent in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, and Node.JS. You can view more of my work at my [Website](https://rhet0rical.dev).

# Contact & Contribution ðŸ“«
I'll usually be available through my email at me@rhet0rical.dev, and if that isn't your style, you can always contact me throught my Twitter too! Send me a DM at @TheRhet0rical, and i'll get back to you there instead.

Although a majority of my projects are hosted on here, i'm not always avidly working on them. But still feel free to add any improvements to my projects, or fork it and turn it into something cooler. I always love seeing people's ideas and creative masterpeices.
