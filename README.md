# Hello 👋, Im Rhet0rical!
Or Keegan, however you might possibly know me by.
 
## Im a Fullstack *mainly* backend developer based in **Michigan** 😎.
You can mainly check a majority of what i've built in GitHub itself, but sometimes the projects can be a bit more widespread on different sites such as [Replit](https://replit.com/@Rhet0rical) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_).

Im fluent in languages such as...
- **Python** 🐍
- **Javascript** ☕
- **HTML & CSS (*mostly*)** 🌐

If you wish, you can reach me by @tting me on twitter, adding me on discord at Rhet0rical#2001 if you wanna add me there. You can also email me at rhet0rical@studio-eitmos.com.

## Some Things I've Created
Down here, you'll find a list of some of the software i've made 💻.

> ### **Mocha** ☕ - A Text Based Python Mock OS
> Mocha is a text based operating system built with the Python programming language. Mocha was created because i felt like it, even though it serves almost no utilitarian use, besides the fact that it can be used to sort some Python applications you may have lying around.
