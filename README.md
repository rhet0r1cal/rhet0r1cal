# **Welcome To My GitHub Page!** :wave:
Welcome to my GitHub page! GitHub is usually where I post a majority of my work, so feel free to take a peek at any of the stuff you may find here. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to [reach out](#contact--contributing), i'm usually available.

## **About Me**
I am a *work in progress* software developer based in michigan, currently fluent in languages such as...
* **Javascript & HTML** :coffee:, for frontend development.
* **Python** :snake:, for backend development.

## **Projects**
Here are some of the projects you'll find on my page, besides the one's that are private of course *(sitting at 13 right now)*:

### **Project 1**: [mocha-python](https://github.com/TheRhet0rical/mocha-python) :snake: *(archived)*
Mocha is a text based operating system built with the Python programming language. Mocha was created because i felt like it, even though it serves almost no utilitarian use, besides the fact that it can be used to sort some Python applications you may have lying around.

### **Project 2**: [install-script](https://github.com/TheRhet0rical/install-script) :scroll: *(archived)*
A quick Windows' batch script I put together so i could install various programs at once without going to each individual website.

### **Project 3**: [setup-script](https://github.com/TheRhet0rical/setup-script) :newspaper: *(active)*
A project based on **install-script**, it's a Windows batch file script I created so I can install my programs I use, and set up my computer in one click.
