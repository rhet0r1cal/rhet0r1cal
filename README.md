# Nice to meet you, I'm Rhet0rical ðŸ‘‹
> Website: **https://rhet0rical.dev**

I'm an *almost* fullstack developer fluent in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Along with Python, and Node.js for more backend server services. I've also gained some experience in NW.js.

# Contact ðŸ“«
I check my emails almost every day, so feel free to get a hold of me at me@rhet0rical.dev, and if that isn't your style, you can contact me on my Twitter too, using the handle [@TheRhet0rical](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_), and I'll get back to you there instead.
