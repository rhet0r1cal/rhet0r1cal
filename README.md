# Hello 👋, Im Rhet0rical!
Or Keegan, depending on what you might know me by.
 
## Im a WIP software developer 😎.
You can mainly check a majority of what I've built in GitHub itself, but sometimes the projects I make can be a bit more widespread, like on different sites such as [Replit](https://replit.com/@Rhet0rical) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_).

I'm mostly fluent in languages such as...
- **Python** *(both frontend or backend)*🐍
- **Javascript or TypeScript Using Node.js** ☕
- **Markdown** *if you count that as a language* 🤖

If you wish, you can reach me by @tting me on Twitter or emailing me at rhet0rical@studio-eitmos.com.

## Some Things I've Created
Down here, you'll find a list of some of the software I've made 💻.

> **Mocha ☕ - A Text-Based Python Mock OS (discontinued)** \
> Mocha is a text-based operating system built with the Python programming language. Mocha was created because i felt like it, even though it serves almost no utilitarian use, besides the fact that it can be used to sort some Python applications you may have lying around. You Can Find Mocha [Here](https://github.com/TheRhet0rical/mocha-python)

> **Rhet0rical's Install Script** \
> A quick Windows batch script I put together so i could install various programs at once without going to each website. You can find it [Here](https://github.com/TheRhet0rical/install-script)

## Thanks For Checking Me Out 😄!
