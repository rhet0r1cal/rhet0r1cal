I'm a 17 y/o software developer, or another one of those unfortunate souls who've sold their soul to the internet for more than 6 years.

I'm experienced in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, Typescript, and Python. Along with that, I also have experience with tools such as React, Next.js, and data storage and server software like Supabase, Cloudflare, and Firebase.

I look forward to working with you!
