This goes over the basics, i'm always posting stuff and improving my work. Take a look at my full repository list to get a good look at all of my projects i've ever created, as this list won't get updated constantly.

# Contact & Contribution 📫
You can always contact me through email using **rhet0rical@studio-eitmos.com**. I usually respond in a short amount of time *(depending what time it is, EST being my time zone)*. And if that isn't your style, you can always
contact me throught my Twitter too! Send me a DM at [@TheRhet0rical](https://twitter.com/TheRhet0rical_), and i'll get back to you there instead.

Although a majority of my projects are hosted on here, i'm not always avidly working on them. But still feel free to add any improvements to my projects, or fork it and turn it into something cooler. I always love seeing
people's ideas and creative *masterpeices*. But usually for smaller projects, i'll usually have push requests turned off, but issues will still always be there and occasionally worked upon.
